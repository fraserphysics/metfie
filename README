On March 5, 2013, I got email from NoReply@lanl.gov that said in part:

    Copyright Disclosure: CODE-2013-143, Maxentropic Transitions for
    Isentropic Expansion METFIE V1.0 has been approved

    CODE Title: Maxentropic Transitions for Isentropic Expansion
    METFIE V1.0<br /> Primary Author: Andrew Fraser<br /> LACC #:
    LA-CC-13-011<br /> Copyright Number Assigned: C13082<br />

symmetry.ipynb is a notebook.  To work with it, issue:

    ipython3 notebook symmetry.ipynb

To do:

1. Move to google code and tell Christina T Ramos and Kathleen McDonald.

2. Study behavior of \lambdaPF and \vectorPF as dy -> 0

3. Prove or argue that as dy -> 0 limit of measure exists
