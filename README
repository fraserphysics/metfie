I started this project at LANL and it was under svn.  The git log says
I used git-svn to put it under git on Dec. 2 2011 and that the svn
repository is svn+ssh://tu-fe1/users/afraser/SVN/eos.  The log also
says that the last time I used the svn repository was Feb. 3 2012.

In February 2013 as I prepare to submit "Constraining Uncertainty with
Laws of Physics" to the SIAM Journal on Uncertainty Quantification, I
find that the only code relevant to making the figures is in the files
plot.py, MaxH.py and calc.py

On March 5, 2013, I got email from NoReply@lanl.gov that said in part:
