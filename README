On March 5, 2013, I got email from NoReply@lanl.gov that said in part:

symmetry.ipynb is a notebook.  To work with it, issue:

    ipython notebook symmetry.ipynb

November 1, 2013: I started making code for public repository.  I
moved some files from eos/ to eos3/ and set up repository at
cathcart:git_repos/eos3.

To do:

1. Build notes.pdf and juq.pdf using python3

2. Look for alternative machines on which to run converge.py

3. Check second eigenvalue

4. Study behavior of \lambdaPF and \vectorPF as dy -> 0

5. Check with Dan Gerth. Room 3454 Tel. 7-5011.  Note LA-CC-13-011 and
    LA-UR-12-00305

6. Move to google code and tell Christina T Ramos and Kathleen McDonald.
