The like_gun directory is for exploring HE modeling issues using
simple toy models.  To make notes.pdf:

-> git clone https://github.com/fraserphysics/metfie
-> cd metfie/like_gun
-> make notes.pdf

Plans for multiple measurements:

1. Calulate detonation velocity from eos

2. Simulate rate stick measurements

3. Use rate stick data in eos estimation

4. Simulate expanding cylinder

Plans for comparing coordinate systems:

1. Write code that calculates or estimates uncertainty of estimated
   EOS model.

2. Write code that calculates or estimates uncertainty of estimated
   muzzle energy and muzzle time given uncertain EOS model.
   
3. Plot bias/variance pairs for sequences of spline and polynomial
   models with increasing numbers of parameters.

4. Explain all of the above work in notes.tex

Here is an alphabetical list of source files under git in this directory

basis.py:
Makes a plot that illustrates a spline basis function and its derivatives.

eos.py:
Provides EOS classes for experiments and a nominal guess for
optimization.  Also provides spline classes that other modules use.

fit.py:
Contains optimization code.

gun.py
Code for the gun model.  Makes experimental data and used for
optimization in fit.py

Makefile
First and only ultimate target is notes.pdf

notes.tex
Explains models and optimization

plot.py
Provides figures for notes.pdf
