The like_gun directory is for exploring HE modeling issues using
simple toy models.

Plans:

1. Make sure that that the EOS model used for generating simulated
   data is not in any class of fitted models so that there will be
   bias.

2. Develop a stochastic model for the measurements so that there will
   be variance in the estimates of EOS models.

3. Write code that estimates polynomial models for the EOS.

4. Write code that calculates or estimates bias and variance of
   estimated muzzle energy and muzzle time given a parametric EOS
   model.

5. Plot bias/variance pairs for sequences of spline and polynomial
   models with increasing numbers of parameters.

6. Explain all of the above work in notes.tex

7. Devise MAP scheme and explain in notes.tex

8. Implement MAP scheme
