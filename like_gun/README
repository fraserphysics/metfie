The like_gun directory is for exploring HE modeling issues using
simple toy models.  To make notes.pdf:

-> git clone https://github.com/fraserphysics/metfie
-> cd metfie/like_gun
-> make notes.pdf

Plans for multiple measurements:

1. Calulate detonation velocity from eos

2. Simulate rate stick measurements

3. Use rate stick data in eos estimation

4. Simulate expanding cylinder

Plans for comparing coordinate systems:

1. Write code that calculates or estimates uncertainty of estimated
   EOS model.

2. Write code that calculates or estimates uncertainty of estimated
   muzzle energy and muzzle time given uncertain EOS model.
   
3. Plot bias/variance pairs for sequences of spline and polynomial
   models with increasing numbers of parameters.

4. Explain all of the above work in notes.tex
