The like_gun directory is for developing maximum likelihood code for
gun data and models.

Plans:

x1. Extract simple code for gun from parent directory

x2. Write code for spline f

x3. Write perturbed EOS f and use it for gun

x4. Write code for log likelihood L and derivative of L wrt to v_sim

x5. Write code for d v_sim / d f

6. Check that plots of DE are monotonic

7. Write optimization code
